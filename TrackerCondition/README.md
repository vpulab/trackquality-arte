# Software implementation for Tracker condition estimation

## Overview 

This is a set of MATLAB scripts  for estimating the performance of single-object particle filter tracker without using ground-truth data. 
Specifically, the performance is estimated in terms of:
 - tracking condition {LOCKED-ON, LOCKING-IN, SCANNING} 
 - temporal segmentation {SUCCESSFUL, UNSUCCESSFULL} 
 
by analyzing the uncertainty of the filter and the time-reversibility property.

## Requirements

This tool was successfully tested under MS Windows (32-bit and 64-bit) and linux (32-bit).
It requires the MATLAB image processing toolbox.

## Installation

Make sure MATLAB can find all of the scripts that are
included by either making their directory the current directory
or including it in the MATLAB path.

## Running the GUI

Run the GUI by executing the following command in MATLAB:

	tracker_condition_gui();

See 'help tracker_condition_gui' for explanation of the usage of the interface.
Additionally, a 'help' button is included in the interface.

## User Interface

After starting the GUI (see above), you have four interactive areas:
 - Input/output data panel: path to the files with the data to be used by the 
							application and the files where the result will be stored.
 - Settings panel: parameters of the implemented algorithm. Controls of processing (start and stop)
 - Tracker data panel: shows the preloaded tracking data results (single-target tracking)
 - Tracker performance panel: shows the tracker condition estimated and the uncertainty analysis.

## Input specifications

The data used by the application is the following: 
		- Test sequence: uncompressed video vile in AVI format with all the sequence frames
		- Ground-truth annotation: text file with the annotations of the target in the format:	
			<FRAME ID_OBJECT CENTER_X CENTER_Y A B O> where CENTER_X, CENTER_Y, A, B and O represent, 
			respectively, the center coordinates, the major semiaxes, the minor semiaxes and the orientation 
			of the annotated ellipse.
		- Datafile: path to the *.mat file that contains the structure with
		the tracking data (named 'result') obtained by the color-based particle filter. 
		This structure contains the following fields:
           +'videofile': path of the input videofile
           +'gtruthfile': path of the associated ground-truth
           +'start_frame': start frame of the analyzed frames
           +'end_frame': end frame o of the analyzed frames
           +'N': number of samples (particles) used in the tracker
           +'Q': target model used during the tracking process
           +'Ck': noise of the motion model used in the prediction phase
           +'w_par_N': weights of the particles
           +'w_par_NN': particles likelihood (no normalized weights)
           +'state_par': state of particles
           +'state_est': state estimation for the target
           +'der': ground-truth error (ellipse overlap)
           +'OL': Observation likelihood statistic of the particles
           +'SU': Spatial uncertainty statistic of the particles
## Output specifications

The GUI doesn't have a return values. Tracker condition analysis are
stored as a mat file using the 'Output File' textbox. This mat file has a
structure (named 'result_pe') that contains all the information generated. 
It has the following fields:
           +'filename':path of the input videofile
           +'gtruthfile':path of the associated ground-truth
           +'N':number of particles used in the tracker
           +'start_frame': start frame of the analyzed frames
           +'end_frame': end frame o of the analyzed frames
           +'error': ground-truth error (dice coefficient)
           +'analysis': structure 'result' with the tracking data
           +'config':parameter configuration
           +'OL':observation likelihood statistic
           +'SU':spatial uncertainty statistic
           +'SU_ps: uncertainty signal maximized for detecting sudden increases
           +'SU_pl: uncertainty signal maximized for detecting slow increases
           +'SU_ns: uncertainty signal maximized for detecting sudden decreases
           +'SU_ps: uncertainty signal maximized for detecting slow decreases
           +'trk_cond':tracker condition vector {LOCKED-ON (1),LOCKING-IN(0.5), SCANNING(0)}
           +'tracker_status': status of the tracker {SUCCESSFULL(1),UNSUCCESSFULL(0)}
           +'RefP_upd':ignal that indicates the attemps to detect tracker
            recovery after error {successful recovery (=1), wrong recovery(=0.5)}.

Additionally, a MATLAB figure (*.fig) is stored with the main signals generated during the 
tracker condition analysis.
